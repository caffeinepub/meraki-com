The only modified files in the diff are metadata/summary files (frontend-file-summaries.txt and project_state.json), and there is no evidence that the logo asset, header/footer logo usage, or Open Graph image reference were updated.",

      "reason": "The diff shows no change to the required static asset path, no edits to HeaderNav/Footer to use the new logo, and no confirmation that `frontend/index.html` OG image tag still points to `/assets/generated/meraki-logo.dim_1024x1024.png` while rendering the new logo.
